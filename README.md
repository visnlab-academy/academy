instructions for the developers
when ever you are writing a new code for a section or card or CSS

keep a comment like : <!-- faculty section starts-->

                        <!-- faculty section ends -->

write the code in between them so it is easy to find and edit

                      same as in the CSS as well, make sure to write CSS with underscore "_" and not  "-" and also always keep unique class names such that other css will not be disturbed

while adding an image or creating a new file always name it in a single line or word ex: HCLlogo or HCL_logo both are fine but dont keep HCL logo, avoid spaces
